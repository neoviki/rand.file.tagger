## Tag Files Inside a Directory with Random Names

This utility renames all files inside a specified directory using randomly generated file names. The file extensions remain unchanged.

### Application

This tool is particularly useful in scenarios where original file names need to be anonymized or standardized â€” for example, in **movie-making workflows**, where raw footage or asset files must be imported into editing software without relying on descriptive or potentially conflicting filenames.

### Example Use Case

Suppose you have a folder named `raw_footage/` containing several video clips with names like:

```
scene1_take1.mp4
scene2_take1.mp4
clip_final_edit.mov
```

After running this utility, the files will be renamed to something like:

```
12.mp4
19.mp4
39.mov
```

This ensures the file names are consistent and do not interfere with software that may rely on unique naming conventions.
